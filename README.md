# Java Bank application with MySQL DataBase

This Java project is a basic banking system that includes a login/signup window and an ATM window. 
Users can either log into their existing account or create a new account. Once they create an account, users can enter their card number and PIN to access the ATM window and perform transactions.

This Java project also features a Booking System, allowing users to make appointments with bank operators. The booking process is designed to mimic a phone call, with a phone-like interface popping up when the booking button is pressed.
